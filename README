NAME
    Passwd::Keyring::Auto - interface to secure password storage(s)

VERSION
    Version 0.2602

SYNOPSIS
    Passwd::Keyring is about securely preserving passwords and similar
    sensitive data applications use in backends like Gnome Keyring, KDE
    Wallet, OSX/Keychain etc.

    While modules like Passwd::Keyring::Gnome handle specific backends,
    Passwd::Keyring::Auto tries to pick the best backend available,
    considering the current desktop environment.

        use Passwd::Keyring::Auto qw(get_keyring);

        my $keyring = get_keyring(app=>"My super scraper", group=>"Social passwords");

        my $username = "someuser";
        my $password = $keyring->get_password($username, "mylostspace.com");
        if(! $password) {
            # ... somehow interactively prompt for password
            $keyring->set_password($username, $password, "mylostspace.com");
        }
        login_somewhere_using($username, $password);
        if( password_was_wrong ) {
            $keyring->clear_password($username, "mylostspace.com");
        }

    If any secure backend is available, password is preserved for successive
    runs, and users need not be prompted.

    Instead of auto-detection, one can also be explicit:

        use Passwd::Keyring::Gnome;
        my $keyring = Passwd::Keyring::Gnome->new();
        # ... and so on

EXPORT
    get_keyring

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  get_keyring
        my $ring = get_keyring()

        my $ring = get_keyring(app=>'symbolic application name', group=>'symbolic group/folder/.. name');

        my $ring = get_keyring(app=>'...', group=>'...', %backend_specific_options);

    Returns the keyring object most appropriate for the current system.
    Passess all options received to this backend. See
    Passwd::Keyring::Auto::KeyringAPI for available operations on keyring
    and their semantic.
